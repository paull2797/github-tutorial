## Git vs. GitHub

Git is the version control, which keeps snapshots of the code. Git doesn't need Github. Github stores code, tracks changes made, and used to collaborate on files. Github needs Git to work.

## Initial Setup

Before you start using Github, you have to create an account. Go to [Github](https://github.com/) and click sign up. If you're an HSTAT student, it is recommended to use your HSTAT email (without the @hstat.org) as your username. Now that you've created your github account, you can use the [IDE](https://ide.cs50.io/). Make sure to use the SSH key, so the website doesn't keep asking for your login information.
